# My Project

Welcome to Leif's AI Image Generator. 
This is a full-stack application that combines a backend route server with a frontend Vue.js application to create our own AI image generator using stability ai.

## Features

- Generates images using the Stability AI API.
- Allows users to input text and generate corresponding images.
- Displays the generated images in a responsive image gallery.
- Supports image enlargement, deletion, and download.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- npm (version X.X.X)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone 
pnpm install

Create a .env file in the project root directory.
Add the following environment variables to the .env file:

API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Replace with your Stability AI API key.

Usage
